      <description>&amp;hellip;and complex is better than complicated.
This has always been my motto. All my lines of code have simplicity as their primary goal.
I decided to start this blog, to tell about my IT adventures, to describe all my projects and experiences, so that they can help others.
Open Source To apply my motto, one of the principles that drives all my works, is the open source philosophy. Each of my projects is open source.</description>
