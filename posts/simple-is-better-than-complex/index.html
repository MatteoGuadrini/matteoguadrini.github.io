    <p>&hellip;and complex is better than complicated.</p>
<p>This has always been my motto. All my lines of code have simplicity as their primary goal.</p>
<p>I decided to start this blog, to tell about my IT adventures, to describe all my projects and experiences, so that they can help others.</p>
<h2 id="open-source">Open Source</h2>
<p>To apply my motto, one of the principles that drives all my works, is the open source philosophy.
Each of my projects is <strong>open source</strong>. Every single line of code is for everyone who wants to use my libraries and tools, but above all who wants to <!-- raw HTML omitted -->contribute.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<h2 id="python">Python</h2>
<p>My favorite language for creating nice and useful tools, libraries and things is <strong>python</strong>.</p>
<p>I learned to write in python in the year 2005, in python 2.4. Initially, I wrote some scripts for client automatisms. Nothing really useful but it all starts with studying and &ldquo;<em>random things</em>&rdquo;.</p>
<p>In December 2008, python 3 was released. I abandoned development in python 2 and embraced the new release. With this version I started to seriously study the language; initially through Mark Lutz&rsquo;s &ldquo;<em>Learning Python</em>&rdquo; book and then with the following book &ldquo;<em>Programming Python</em>&rdquo;.</p>
<h2 id="linux">Linux</h2>
<p>My first operating system was Mandrake with KDE 1.2 as the desktop environment. Since then, <strong>Linux</strong> kernel based operating systems have accompanied me in my personal and work life. In 2008, along with python 3, <em>fedora core</em> (now <a href="https://getfedora.org/">fedora</a> only) is my favorite operating system. I also used debian based OS, like ubuntu and other distros.</p>
<h2 id="other-languages">Other languages</h2>
<p>Over the years and my studies, I have learned various programming languages. <em>Bash</em> was one of the first, followed by <em>Perl</em> and <em>PHP</em> for web programming. <em>C#</em> and <em>powershell</em> on Windows environments. But python, it always remains my favorite.</p>
<h2 id="lets-go">Let&rsquo;s go!</h2>
<p>My life is decorated with personal and work projects that I want to describe and tell you readers.
This blog was born for those who want to learn or compare their works and libraries with mine. It was also born to try to describe all the use cases of my projects but above all to entice people to work with my projects and maybe &hellip; develop new features. Everyone is welcome.</p>
