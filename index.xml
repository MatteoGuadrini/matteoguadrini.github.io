      <description>Virtual machine out of control Does not turn off! On a typical day in a DevOps it is very likely that it will have to create or manage virtual machines, sometimes very important because production processes are running on them. Very often, it happens that maintenance, you have to restart or shut down these machines to move them to site or host.
One of the most used virtual machine managers is ESxi from vmware.</description>

      <title>Python Stubs</title>

      <description>What is a stub file? It is a file with the .pyi extension, which describes the Python type information, both input and return for functions and omits the logical part. Using a stub file has the following advantages (see PEP 484).
Example sample.py
def stringify(what): return str(what) Example sample.pyi
from typing import Union def stringify(what: Union[int, list, dict]) -&amp;gt; str: ... Advantages Type information can be added by adding a separate stub file to a third-party library that does not have type annotations.</description>

      <description>Is CentOS&amp;hellip;dead? CentOS is a Linux distribution that provides a free and open-source community-supported computing platform, functionally compatible with its upstream source, Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL). In December 2020, Red Hat unilaterally terminated CentOS development. In response, CentOS founder, Gregory Kurtzer, created the Rocky Linux project as a successor to the original mission of CentOS.
Rocky Linux Rocky Linux is a Linux distribution that is intended to be a downstream, complete binary-compatible release using the Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) operating system source code.</description>

      <description>A new data type Before talking about the Either data type, we need to know what a data type is.
A data type is an abstraction that encapsulates one reusable coding pattern.
In our case, the Either data type encapsulates two other objects: Left and Right. These two objects represent Error and Success respectively.
This is a common pattern for Functional Programming.
Left and Right Left and Right, are classes wich represent the error and success data.</description>

      <description>Task report In the life of every system manager, sooner or later it has happened to do reporting, or by collecting data from logs, databases as diverse as LDAP servers.
The thing you will surely have done is to collect data manually, using tools like grep and awk for configuration files and logs.
$ cat example.log | grep &#39;ERROR&#39; $ awk &#39;{print $2}&#39; example.log Or a bash script that analyzes each row and then selects only those of interest.</description>

      <description>Fun terminal tools There are very useful command line tools, which are used for daily administration, whatever the job you have to do, an example are find, grep, cat, less, etc. There are also more complex tools that require the study and consultation of manuals such as docker, vagrant, etc. and are for advanced users such as systems engineers and developers.
Other tools are used &amp;hellip; well, practically nothing, except to elicit a laugh.</description>

      <description>In the life of a designer or font maker, the need arises to see how a font looks on a certain image, with a certain color and size, or simply, have a reliable preview of the final result. To do this, graphical tools are required.
Preview of a font To work with font previews, there are system previewers at the level of any operating system. This is a great starter tool to see what a font will look like on our project.</description>

      <title>Samba File Server</title>

      <description>Why a file server? One of the most common ways to network Linux and Windows computers is to configure Samba as a File Server. This section covers setting up a Samba server to share files with Windows clients.
Configure Samba First of all, you have to prepare your machine with everything you need. To do this server, I&amp;rsquo;m using a Fedora 33 server OS. Let&amp;rsquo;s start by installing the packages needed to make our server a Samba file server.</description>

      <description>Measure the execution time Measuring the execution time of a script or program is part of a developer&amp;rsquo;s daily job.
It is not enough to see if it consumes too much memory or too much CPU. We need to see if the software in its entire life cycle is fast enough.
This is because the business logic of any software expects a certain task to be completed with a maximum time established by the programmer himself.</description>

      <description>When can a network be considered more or less secure?
Tools to protect yourself There are many tools that are used to protect against external intruders: firewall, fail2ban, vmam.
Firewall In a network the information exchanged can be of various nature and a given node may not always want to allow this information to be visible to all the other nodes in the network or to receive information of any type from the other nodes.</description>

      <guid>https://matteoguadrini.github.io/posts/zen-of-open-source/</guid>
      <description>Open philosophy When can a project be defined as open-source? When, as the word says, you open the source code and make it available to other people.
Of course, this is the first concept behind the open-source philosophy. But there is more.
Open source license To make a project open-source first, you need to release it with a certain license. In fact, there are a lot of them. They all share the main philosophy, but differ from each other in small points.</description>

      <description>Why a backup is needed Having a backup system is necessary to ensure continuity to your systems, whatever work they do.
Backup systems can be simple if few machines are involved or complex in case there are hundreds of thousands of machines, such as in the cloud.
What to choose If your ecosystem includes a few machines, you will probably want to choose something simple .
A good and simple backup system is rsync.</description>

      <description>What powershell? Powershell is an object-based shell born in Microsoft in 2006, made open source 10 years later. It is characterized by commands, called cmdlets, which respect a certain pattern. An example cmdlet is as follows:
Get-ChildItem -Path value The pattern in question is Verb-Noun -Option argument, where Verb is a list of verbs. Noun is a description of what impacts the command verb. The Option instead are preceded by a dash and its name; to follow, all the arguments of the option.</description>

      <description>Developing python projects When we develop more than one python project, we need to configure our development environment with the dependencies of all the projects. This becomes even more complicated when there are many people on the development of the project. To do this, you need to create a development environment that is isolated from the others. We can do this thanks to docker containers.
Prepare project Let&amp;rsquo;s imagine that our project has this structure:</description>

      <description>What is a switch? The switch is a statement that evaluates the accuracy or similarity of the value of a certain input. But isn&amp;rsquo;t that the same thing that the if statement does? Let&amp;rsquo;s see this statement starting with bash scripting language.
case EXPRESSION in PATTERN_1) STATEMENTS ;; PATTERN_2) STATEMENTS ;; PATTERN_N) STATEMENTS ;; *) STATEMENTS ;; esac EXPRESSION is an expression (command) or a variable. PATTERN_N, is a value that is expected from EXPRESSION.</description>

      <description>&amp;hellip;and complex is better than complicated.
This has always been my motto. All my lines of code have simplicity as their primary goal.
I decided to start this blog, to tell about my IT adventures, to describe all my projects and experiences, so that they can help others.
Open Source To apply my motto, one of the principles that drives all my works, is the open source philosophy. Each of my projects is open source.</description>
