      <description>Is CentOS&amp;hellip;dead? CentOS is a Linux distribution that provides a free and open-source community-supported computing platform, functionally compatible with its upstream source, Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL). In December 2020, Red Hat unilaterally terminated CentOS development. In response, CentOS founder, Gregory Kurtzer, created the Rocky Linux project as a successor to the original mission of CentOS.
Rocky Linux Rocky Linux is a Linux distribution that is intended to be a downstream, complete binary-compatible release using the Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) operating system source code.</description>

$ cat example.log | grep &amp;#39;ERROR&amp;#39; $ awk &amp;#39;{print $2}&amp;#39; example.log Or a bash script that analyzes each row and then selects only those of interest.</description>

      <description>Open philosophy When can a project be defined as open-source? When, as the word says, you open the source code and make it available to other people.
Of course, this is the first concept behind the open-source philosophy. But there is more.
